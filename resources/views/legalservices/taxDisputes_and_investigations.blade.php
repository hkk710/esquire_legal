                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                        We act for and defend businesses and individuals of all shapes and sizes caught up in a wide range of domestic and international tax disputes and interactions with other tax authorities. An area of core expertise involves Direct Tax disputes, GST disputes,
                        Investigations, and recovery of input tax, Customs. Our job is to challenge the Department when they seek to act, as they sometimes do, outside of their powers. Clients are drawn from almost every sector as no one is immune from
                        the Department and taxes. We can step in at any stage from the initial enquiry letter issued by Department through to tax litigation and settlement with the Department. Many of our cases do settle which is almost invariably good
                        news for any taxpayer. We offer the practical and legal skills needed to defend against the actions of the Department. Accountants find it helpful to entrust a case such as a Income tax and GST disputes to us, knowing that we evaluate
                        the evidence from a legal standpoint and reach an early assessment as to the merits while being able to defend the proceedings robustly before the Tax Tribunal/ Department. We can guide you through the entire process, analysing
                        where the concerned Department has misapplied the law and leveraging upwards from that point. We have many years’ of experience in resisting demands for taxes and penalties on behalf of businesses. The Departments have internal
                        targets to meet for the amount of taxes, penalties, and interest that they recover. If the investigation is not handled properly, this could result in serious financial disadvantage, even bankruptcy, to you and your business.
