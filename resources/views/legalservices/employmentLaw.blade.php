                        The Central Government has taken effective steps of codifying 29 laws into 4 Codes so that workers can get the security along with respect, health, and other welfare measures with ease. The Labour Tribunal is proposed to institutionalize a vibrant mechanism
                        for the speedy disposal of cases. To ensure security for all workers, the Central Government has amalgamated 9 Labour Laws into the Social Security Code in order to secure the right of workers to insurance, pension, gratuity, maternity
                        benefit etc. Three Labour Laws have been amalgamated into the Industrial Relations Code for safeguarding the interests of Trade Unions as well as the workers so that there is minimal scope for disputes in the future.
